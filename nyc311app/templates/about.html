		<h4>Why did we choose NYC 311 Data?</h4>
		<p>Outside of it being a clean data set, we live in NYC and are curious to learn more about what New Yorkers like to complain about.</p>
	</ul>

<h3>Description of Data</h3>

	<ul>
		<p>We got the data from NYC Open Data website. We're only working with the data from February 2018. Why February? Well it's a recent month and working with a full year is expensive both in time and cpu. New Yorkers report a lot of complaints. Specifically, just 200,000 complaints for February 2018. The data for February 2018 is 125 MB. You could download the csv below.</p>

<h3>The Strugle Is Chill</h3>

<p>We began with an ambitious idea of scraping real estate data and predicting where it's best to live in NYC. We quickly came to a realization that we wouldn't have enough enough time for exploratory data analysis or even the idea to use shiny to showcase our work.</p>

<p>After we got that out of our system and realized that we didn't have a lot of time, we settled on using clean data provided by NYC Open Data. We spent a good chunk of our time getting up to speed with shiny and displaying some of our exploratory results.</p>

	<ul>We got kicked off of Shiny several times with a "Disconnected from the server", as a result of using up to much of our free resources.</ul>
