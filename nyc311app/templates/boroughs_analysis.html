<!-- 
<p>Given we're reviewing data from February, a pretty cold month, most complaints are about "Heat/Hot Water". Makes sense. Queens appears to be a bit of an outlier and does not have as many complaints about "Heat/Hot Water" as the other boroughs. Staten Island doesn't complain much period.</p>
