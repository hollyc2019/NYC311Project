<h3>The What (Number of Complaints)</h3>

	In the Borough section, we did not cover why a proportion of the complaints were submitted without a Borough specified, which were labeled Unspecified. There are two reasons for this: The first being that many of the complaints lacking a Borough did in fact have a city assigned, but the agent submitting the record must not have known which Borough the city aligns to. We had discussed ways of correcting this, and leveraging columns latitude and longitude to map to zip code would resolve this issue; this is a future endeavor we could pursue post this project. The second reason can be seen in the below bar chart. We can see that the Unspecified borough is almost entirely comprised of the complaint type DOF Literature (Department of Finance Literature). Very interestingly, the NYC 311 legal document has a clause within the 311-privacy-policy that personal information and location is collected only when “reasonably necessary) (4.1 Where personal information is reasonably necessary to provide ongoing assistance to a client, the 311 Contact Center shall retain that information that is reasonably sufficient to enable the provision of such service until it is determined that retention is no longer necessary). It is our hypothesis that this clause is the reason for the requests for information such as DOF Literature Request (which clocked in 95 thousand requests over a 5 year period) have no Borough specified.

	Looking at the 3 boroughs with the highest populations, Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn we can see something interesting which aligns with our basic understanding of the lifestyle differences. Whilst Brooklyn and Queens see frequent complaints for Blocked Driveways, Manhattan sees nearly zero. This matches our intuition of the dwelling types in Manhattan: largely skyrise apartments, with few driveways in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	 Another interesting point gleaned from this chart is viewable when adding The Bronx in to the query, where once it appeared that Brooklyn saw the most Heat/Hot Water complaints, The Bronx, with its population 1.2M people less than Brooklyn, sees nearly 1000 more complaints of this type! This begs one to consider if the living conditions in The Bronx are truly more difficult.

<h3>The How (long until resolution)</h3>
<img src="borough_analysis_how_1.png" height="400" width="650" style="float: right; width: 800px; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;" /> 
<p>
	To discern the complaint time it took for resolution, we simply subtracted the complaint opening date and time from the closing date and time. To start, let’s select all complaint types. By comparing to the highest frequency complaint type from “The What” section, Heat/Hot Water, we see that the time to resolution at around 100 hrs is proportionally quite efficient. However, complaints such as Unsanitary Condition, Plumbing and Paint/Plaster ,whilst not in the interquartile range of all complaint types during the month, have a mean time to resolution of 300 hours. This begs the question for follow-up to discern if these types of complaints are more difficult to resolve because of their nature, or because fewer complaints of those type occur as compared to the most frequently submitted complaints such as Heat/Hot Water, Request bulky Item Collection, and Noise - Residential, so less effort is invested in to the resolution by the 
	respected agency.

<h3>The When</h3>

<p>
	This line graph shows some interesting information on general life habits of the people of New York City. We can see that starting at around midnight complaint submissions sharpy decrease until the trough at 4am. We then see a sharp rise in submissions while New Yorkers are starting their day until the peak at 11 am. This is also another view in addition to “The What” bar chart to show the scaled differences between the concentration of complaints by Borough.

<h3>The Where</h3>

</center> 
<p>
	Now we can finally visualize where the complaints are originating. This static heat map shows the alpha bended nodes of where complaints are most common. We can see that many of the complaints in Brooklyn are from the Flatbush/Bedstuy area, Manhattan shows a heavy concentration in the East Village and Soho neighborhoods along with the Harlem and Washington Heights area, while the Bronx is simply less geographically spaced for such a high volume of calls. And as expected, Staten Island shows miniscule concentration.

<h2>Data Cleaning Process</h2>
<br>
<center><b><i>Data Cleaning is the same for both Complaints and Boroughs</i></b></center>
<br>

<ul>
	<p>
		There are 191,314 complaints for the month of February. Our goal is to explore each borough and report on what New Yorkers like to complain about. The downside of exploring complaints is that <i>311 data</i> has 221 of them. 
	</p>

	<p>
		In order to account for all complaint types we created our own categories. After doing so, we noticed that we might have over-categorized some complaints. Mapping <i>Street Light Condition</i> and <i>Traffic Signal Condition</i> to just <i>Street Condition</i>, seems like a good idea, until we realized that they both tell a different story and happen during different times. We chose to subset and filter our data by the top 15 most common complaints. This took the data down to 119,877 complaints or 63% of the original dataset.
	</p>

	<p>
		This data set is pretty clean, but still has some missing fields. Of the remaining 119,877 complaints, 4,144 rows of the <b>Borough</b> column are classified as <i>Unspecified</i>. Our interpretation of what this means is that the person who called simply wanted some information rather than to complain and location wasn't necessary. We also noticed that the column <b>City</b>, at times, indicated Newark and the <b>Borough</b> for that complaint in <i>Unclassified</i>. We're assuming that some complaints our made from outside the city.
	</p>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges With Tools</h2>
<ul>
	<p>We'll describe the challenges we got past with the tools we used.</p>

	<h3>GitHub</h3>

		<ul>GitHub limits the size of files allowed on their server to 100 mb. Our file is ~125MB.</ul>
		<br>
		<ul>We learned about <b>git LFS</b>, an extension that allows large files to exist on the repo. The large file shows up in github with text pointers on how to retrieve the data from a remote server. Not very helpful, since we're working with publicly available data.</ul>
		<br>
		<ul>We chose to clean the large csv file locally and upload the clean versions of data. They were much smaller.</ul>
		<br>
		<ul>You could get the original file here: <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/api/views/fhrw-4uyv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&query=select+*+where+%60created_date%60+%3E%3D+%272018-02-01T00%3A00%3A00%27+AND+%60created_date%60+%3C+%272018-02-28T23%3A59%3A59%27">DOWNLOAD 311 FEBRUARY DATA (125 MB)</a></ul>

	<h3>Shiny</h3>

		<ul>Shiny is great and we were quick to deploy the app that you're looking at now. Getting up to speed with Navigation Tabs, structing the UI and Server did take some time, but not as much as we thought.</ul>
		<br>
		<ul>We got kicked off of Shiny, several times with a "Disconnected from the server", when using up too much of their free resources. We we're attempting to plot a heat map using ggmap. Running it locally took 10 seconds but the public server couldn't handle it. We settled on saving the image plot we created and sourcing the image locally instead of continuously crashing the server.</ul>
		<br>
		<ul>In the midst of us creating the app, we got an email from Shiny indicating that we used up all of the allotted server time (24 hours). Well, $9 a month isn't bad, so we went for it. We plan to cancel the subscription after the class and settle for the 24 hours of server time for each month.</ul>

	<h3>R Studio</h3>
		<ul>R Studio is the best way to edit R code. Just remember to manually save your work time to time before the computer dies or something crashes. Otherwise, you might lose 2 hours of good work.</ul>
		<br>
		<ul>Time to time we'd like to substitue new code for old without deleting old code. We're in the habit of highlting the code and pressing <b>Cmnd ?</b>, to comment out code. R doesn't seem to support that. Other IDE's do.</ul>

</ul>
